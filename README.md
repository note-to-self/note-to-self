## Overview

Note to Self is an app that seeks to aid users in their goal to rewire their inner dialogue from negative self-talk to affirmative new habits. Users can do this by creating an account and scheduling sms messages to be sent once, daily or weekly. Users can view their own scheduled affirmations as well as see anonymous affirmations by other users on the community page.

## Technologies used
